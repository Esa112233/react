# Next.js/React.js/Tailwind CSS Application

This is a simple Next.js/React.js application with Tailwind CSS that serves as a personal portfolio website. It contains information about Esa Abuzar (Me!), including my introduction, links to social profiles, an "About Me" section, a "Portfolio" section showcasing my projects, and a "Work Experience" section. The application also incorporates a light mode to accommodate user preferences.
